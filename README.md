Project for Operating Systems in C

## What is it?
This project is inspired by a Stream Processing network like [Apache Storm][1]. It simulates a network of components to filter, modify and process several events. It is meant for Linux systems, and it introduces the concepts of pipes and signals. It is able to run several [commands](COMMANDS.mdown).

## How do I run it?
Use `make`.

## And how do I use it?
You can type all of your commands in the controller. If you `inject` someting, a new terminal will open where you can then write more commands.

## Things to improve
- [ ] Add support for MacOS
- [ ] Don't lose information when disconnecting while node is *just reading*
